1. Define the Scope and Requirements:
    Purpose: The AI agent will write technical documents
    Target Audience: Technical writers
    Features: Generating content and proofreading

2. Choose a Development Framework:
    Transformers (Hugging Face)
    Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch

3. Select a Pre-trained Model
    DeepSeek R1 or PaLM (Google)
    Fine-tune the model with your dataset for better performance

4. Prepare Your Dataset
    Data Collection: API/SDK technical documents
    Data Cleaning: Remove noise, irrelevant data, and ensure the data is well-structured.
    Data Augmentation: Increase the dataset size by paraphrasing, synonyms replacement, etc.

5. Train the Model
    Fine-tuning: Use your dataset to fine-tune the pre-trained model for your specific tasks.
    Training Environment: Set up a suitable training environment, possibly using cloud services like AWS, Google Colab, or Azure.
    Evaluate the Model: Test the model on a validation set to ensure it meets your requirements.
